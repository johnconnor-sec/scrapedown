# scrapedown
## A website scraper tool for extracting text with conversion to markdown.md. Files are placed in a directory named after the directory it was found under. Creates a file tree that replicates the site's.

This is one of my first solo projects and is completely free to anyone who thinks its cool. If anything I think it could work for finding interesting endpoints. 

Just clone it and after installing the dependencies run `python3 main.py`. Watch it work.
