# scrapedown
## A website scraper tool for extracting text with conversion to markdown.md. Files are placed in a directory named after the directory it was found under. Creates a file tree that replicates the site's.

## To install:

`git clone https://github.com/newb-saibot/scrapedown`

`cd scrapedown`

`pip install poetry`

`poetry install`

### Run it with:

`python3 main.py`

The tool now includes links gathered from the site and a better output of the markdown text.

This is one of my first solo projects and is completely free to anyone who thinks its cool. If anything I think it could work for finding interesting endpoints. 

Just clone it and after installing the dependencies run `python3 main.py`. Watch it work.

If you'd like to make this project better, please show me what you have made!
